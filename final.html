    <hr>
    <h4>My name is Mourik Chaganti, I was born in michigan, but moved to Missouri at a young age. 
        I practically was raised in Missouri. I enjoy playing sports, video games, and trying new
         things. Currently one of my favorite things right now is videography and photos. I have a
          old camera I take photos when im with my friends. Another thing I enjoy is cliff jumping.
           Now that the weather is getting better i am excited to hopefully find some new cliff jumping
            spots and have fun. I also enjoy looking at the sunset.</h4>
